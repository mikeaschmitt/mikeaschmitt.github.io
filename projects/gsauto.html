            <p>testing  teams  to  automate  the  process  of  running individual  tests  rather </p>
            <p>than run them manually. The program saves the users a few days of work by running</p>
            <p>overnight and finishing  the next day. After the tests  complete  the information</p>
            <p>is stored into an excel document with another tab of the program.</p>
